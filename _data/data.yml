      tagline: |
        A python library that helps with checking for driving fines/obligations
        from the official government website. Since the website is very unstable,
        this handles most of the ways it can break. The motivation behind creating this
        is to use it as a base for my own HomeAssistant integration. I've split them up
        so that the library can be used standalone by whoever may need it.
